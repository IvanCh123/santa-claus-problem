# Santa Claus Problem: Thread Synchronization

Santa repeatedly sleeps until wakened by either all of his nine rein-deer, back from their holidays, or by a group of three of his ten elves.If awakened by the reindeer, he harnesses each of them to his sleigh,delivers toys with them and finally unharnesses them (allowing themto go off on holiday). If awakened by a group of elves, he shows eachof the group into his study, consults with them on toy R&D andfinally shows them each out (allowing them to go back to work).Santa should give priority to the reindeer in the case that there isboth a group of elves and a group of reindeer waiting.
